<h2> Title</h2>
<p>frameOfPresentedViewInContainerView, controls the frame of the View Controller we are about to present. This is where smaller views like alerts, popovers, etc are sized. Since we wanted our View Controller to be 200pt in height, we do so here. containerViewWillLayoutSubviews, implement this method to resize any views in your custom layout. In our example we take the view of the presented View Controller and use the previously mentioned method. Finally presentationTransitionWillBegin, gets called when the presentation is about to begin. This is the ideal place to insert any custom or decoration views. You may ask, what is that PSPDFTouchForwardingView class? It&rsquo;s something created by the super smart people at PSPDFKit that I took the liberty of converting to Swift, its usage can be explained in a single tweet.</p>
